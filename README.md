react-mario-side-scroller
A basic Mario-like sidescroller made using React.js. This one works right inside your browser, relies on an HTML canvas to render stuff, features straightforward controls - like moving around, leaping over gaps - with baddies to dodge, coins to grab, plus a fluid follow-along view that shifts smoothly as you go. Development kicked off September 9th, 2025, wrapping up before October rolled in.
